# 8bit Screenie
A screenie is a interactive screen saver with a specific theme, for thought clarity purposes or relaxation. In this case, the theme is my childhood game characters all having fun in the park, which brings me back.

## Tech Used
This screenie is mostly CSS3, and Javascript using HTML. To make the characters move, keyframes would have been ideal but I wanted to get to know set intervals and conditons more, to achieve the same functionality. This was one of my first projects to have a basic idea of animation concepts.

All characters on this screenie are either PNG cropped images, GIFS, or both. All in constant motion, expecially the sky. [Share my experience.](http://surgeon-emma-33727.bitballoon.com/)

## Major Future Improvements
-I am looking forward to fixing the infinite marathon of mario and megaman (which causes my CPU to over heat in several minutes).

-Deploy this as an actual screen saver.

-Have the animations stop exactly where it started, to give it the infinite cycle effect when edited in a video loop.

-Most importantly making the scale of all the props be responsive.
